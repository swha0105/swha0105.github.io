# Skills

---

### Python
My main programming language. I've been working with it for over 2~3 years. I've used it for data progressing especially big and large data set related with physics. I experienced many modules for various purposes such as Cv2, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy for general propose processing and Networkx, Scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow for ML/DL.  

**Keywords: Large scale data processing, Scikit-learn, Keras-Tensorflow**

### MATLAB
My auxiliary tool for programming and visualization. Since I've worked with Matlab for 6~7 years, but not much intensive experience than python. Mainly, I used it for 3D Visualization and specific module which doesn't work in Python such as 3D image toolbox, VolumeViewer  

**Keywords: 3D data processing & visualization**

### FORTRAN & MPI
I've worked with it for 7~8 years and has been used for developing code for MHD physics simulation and implementation of applied mathematics schemes. 
For parallelization (MPI, Message Passing Interface), which is main work in my master thesis, I trained 3 years intensively and successfully adopted parallelization to scientific code

**Keywords: Scientific code with applied Mathematics & Physics, Parallelization with Supercomputer** 

### Linux & E.T.C
I've experiences linux enviornment more than 7 years and managed Lab supercomputer for 3 years. For nowdays, I'm using linux as WSL + Docker for my development enviornemnt. 

Also, I hosted conference web page in Ubuntu server with Nginx and MariaDB  [Homepage Link](https://fm6.unist.ac.kr/) and gitpages with jekyll
