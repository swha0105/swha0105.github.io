# Skills

### Python

수정해야됨.

My main programming language. I've been working with it for over 2~3 years. I've used it for data progressing especially big and large data set related with physics. I experienced many modules for various purposes such as Cv2, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy for general propose processing and Networkx, Scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow for ML/DL.  
For CS knowledge, I studied and implemented codes containing concept of Algorithms, Data structure. Hash, Stack/Queue, Heap, Dynamic programming, DFS/BFS and Binary search were adopted for developing codes.

Keywords: Data preprocessing, Scikit-learn, Keras-Tensorflow, 

### MATLAB

My auxiliary tool for programming and visualization. Since I've worked with Matlab for 6~7 years, but not much intensive experience than python. Mainly, I used it for 3D Visualization and specific module which doesn't work in Python such as 3D image toolbox, VolumeViewer  

Keywords: 3D data processing & visualization 

### FORTRAN & MPI

It is my main tools for science works. I've worked with it for 7~8 years. Mostly, I used Fortran 90 with Intel Fortran compiler. It has been used for developing code for MHD physics simulation and implementation of applied mathematics schemes. 

For parallelization (MPI, Message Passing Interface), which is main work in my master thesis, I trained 3 years intensively and successfully adopted not only FORTRAN code but FFT codes with various domain such as cuboids, sliced domain. Furthermore, I applied Hybrid parallelization method that used OPENMP with MPI.  

Keywords: Scientific code --? ,Parallelization with Supercomputer??, 

### Spark 

### Linux & 나머지?
For supercomputer, I managed Lab supercomputer for 3 years. I used bash shell to control Linux environment and program install. 
Personally, I am using my personal desktop with Ubuntu and Linux Mint for 4~5 years. 

docker, WSL, 이런거 잘한다.

Also, I hosted conference web page in Ubuntu server with Nginx and MariaDB  [Homepage Link](http://fm6.unist.ac.kr/) 그리고 이 페이지.
